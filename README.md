As we all know that the world is fighting against the Covid-19 pandemic, and social distancing is one of the most important defenses against covid-19. People are asked to limit their interaction with each other, reducing the chances of the disease being spread with physical or close contact. This project helps us to detect the Distance between two or more peoples at public places and workplaces.

It can potentially detect each person in real-time, and return a bounding box that turns red if the distance between two peoples is dangerously close. This can be used by governments and any private firms to analyze the movement of people and employees and alert them if the situation turns serious.
